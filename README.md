# Why this GITHUB Page
Using this GIT area to share my cave related electronics projects such as:
## RDF Timer
When using a cave RDF system sometimes it is necessary to setup the in cave transmitter before the surface receiver is ready to be used.
For example the only surface receiver operator may be the person setting up the in cave RDF transmitter. In this case in order to save Tx battery
power it is necessary to delay the start of the RDF Tx to a time that the RDF Rx operator is on the surface.
### Variations
The basic design can be changed into various versions:
* Base Version - Latching Relay power control with battery voltage monitor. (Some details in folder)
* MOSFET Version - External Power control via Low-Side MOSFET module. No onboard Latching Relay. Cheaper due to low cost MOSFET modules. (Needs upload)
* Dual Latching Relays - Supports two external battery connections. Firmware checks No-Load battery voltage to choose which battery to connect to RDF TX. (Needs upload)
